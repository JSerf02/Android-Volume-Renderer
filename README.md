# Android Volume Renderer

An Android app that can render 3D volumetric data such as the results of an MRI scan.

This project was created by *Jacob Serfaty* as his final project for the UChicago
computer science course CMSC 33710: Scientific Visualization taught by Professor
Gordon Kindleman. The rendering algorithm used in this project is the same as 
the algorithm taught in Project 3 of this course, though it is presented very
differently from the C code used in the course so it is more idiomatic to Kotlin.
